## About
SucyBot is a [Discord bot](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro) that utilizes [Discord.net](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net) *(which is also a NuGet package within Visual Studio)*.

There are many features that are included within SucyBot's source code. These include:
- Music functionality. (WIP)
- Simple, fun chat games.
- A "chat leveling" system. (WIP)
- Custom rank generator. (WIP)
- Moderation system.
- Easy to customize source code.

## Installation
**Visual Studio 2015 is required for this bot to work properly.**
1. Download the raw file from this repository.
2. Enter the SucyBotConsole folder and click on the .sln file.
3. Once Visual Studio 2015 is open, click on the "Play" button.
4. A console should appear. The console will ask you for a bot token and a ClientId.
5. Ta-da! You're done!

## Additional Information
Right now, the main purpose of this bot is for my Senior Project. Which, if you cannot tell, is to create a Discord bot with original source code. So some updates are guarenteed to be weekly.

The bot it not fully complete! There are still a lot of functionalities that need to be worked on. These include the music functionality, the chat leveling system, and the custom rank generator. So I apologize for misleading a bit!
